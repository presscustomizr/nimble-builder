The plugin allows you to easily drag-and-drop modules like text-editor, post grids, images, contact forms, maps, icons, or beautiful pre-built sections with a [parallax background](https://docs.presscustomizr.com/article/380-how-to-set-a-parallax-background-for-a-section-in-wordpress-with-the-nimble-builder/?utm_source=wp-org&utm_campaign=nimble-builder-page&utm_medium=link), into any page of your site.
