== Description ==
= What is Nimble Page Builder ? =
**[Nimble Page Builder](https://nimblebuilder.com/?utm_source=wp-org&utm_campaign=nimble-builder-page&utm_medium=link)** is a fast and agile page builder plugin for WordPress. Nimble Builder uses the live customizer which is the native and powerful WordPress interface for real-time design.
The plugin allows you to easily drag-and-drop modules like text-editor, post grids, images, contact forms, maps, icons, or beautiful pre-built sections with a [parallax background](https://docs.presscustomizr.com/article/380-how-to-set-a-parallax-background-for-a-section-in-wordpress-with-the-nimble-builder/?utm_source=wp-org&utm_campaign=nimble-builder-page&utm_medium=link), into any page of your site. You can edit your sections in real-time, and then click "publish" when you are happy with the result, or save for later.
